        <h2>2. ACCESS TO SERVICES</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>2.1. MyFellowPet is a digital platform that facilitates interactions between pet parents (“Users”) and independent third-party service providers offering pet-related services (“Service Providers”). These services are made available for discovery, comparison, communication, and booking through the Platform. MyFellowPet acts solely as an <strong>aggregator and facilitator</strong> and does not own, control, or directly provide any of the services listed on the Platform.
            MyFellowPet operates as a <strong>neutral intermediary</strong> and is not involved in the direct execution or delivery of services. All services are provided independently by Service Providers, who are not employees, agents, or representatives of the Company.
            Service Providers listed on the Platform determine their own service offerings, schedules, and terms, and operate autonomously. Users and Service Providers are solely responsible for the decisions they make, including service selection, booking, and communication.
            While MyFellowPet may provide tools, features, or in-app communication channels to enable smoother coordination, We do not certify, guarantee, or endorse any Service Provider or User. The presence of a Service Provider on the Platform does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement by the Company.</p>
            <p>2.2. All bookings on the Platform are made digitally through the Platform interface. Users may use the integrated chat feature to communicate directly with Service Providers for clarification regarding availability, service details, or specific requirements. Once a User confirms a booking and completes payment through the Platform, the booking will be automatically processed and shared with the relevant Service Provider.</p>
            <p>2.3. Payments for bookings are collected by MyFellowPet through a secure <strong>third-party payment gateway</strong> integrated within the Platform. MyFellowPet facilitates settlement to Service Providers within three (3) to five (5) business days following successful completion of the service, subject to applicable deductions, policies, or verifications. Users agree that payment made through the Platform constitutes valid and sufficient discharge of their payment obligations towards the Service Provider.</p>
            <p>2.4. By using the Platform, You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable right to access and use the Platform solely for personal, non-commercial purposes such as browsing, evaluating, and booking services. Any unauthorized or unlawful use, including commercial exploitation, resale, redistribution, or data scraping, is strictly prohibited.</p>
            <p>2.5. The Company does not assume responsibility for the availability, quality, timing, safety, legality, or performance of services offered by Service Providers. All bookings facilitated through the Platform represent independent arrangements between You and the Service Provider. MyFellowPet shall not be liable for any act, omission, delay, or deficiency by any Service Provider, or for any loss or damage arising therefrom.</p>
            <p>2.6. To access certain features or book services, You may be required to register and create an account (“<strong>Account</strong>”) by providing accurate and up-to-date information such as Your name, contact details, and pet information. You agree that all details submitted are true and current. MyFellowPet reserves the right to verify or validate such information at any time.
            Certain limited information (such as Your pet’s profile or contact number) may be shared with the Service Provider only for the purpose of facilitating bookings and only after You provide <strong>explicit consent</strong>.</p>
            <p>2.7. MyFellowPet reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or permanently terminate access to the Platform if:</p>
            <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>You provide false, outdated, or misleading information;</li>
                <li>You violate any of these Terms or Platform Policies;</li>
                <li>You misuse or abuse any features of the Platform; or</li>
                <li>Your actions adversely affect the reputation, functioning, or integrity of MyFellowPet or any Service Provider.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such suspension or termination shall not entitle You to any compensation, refund, or claim.</p>
            <p>2.8. You agree not to impersonate any person or create more than one active Account. You may not assign, sell, rent, or transfer Your Account to any other person or entity.</p>
            <p>2.9. The availability of services may vary depending on location, Service Provider capacity, and other operational factors. MyFellowPet and its Service Providers reserve the right to modify, limit, or discontinue any service, location, feature, or pricing at any time without prior notice. Users are advised to verify service details before booking.</p>
            <p>2.10. The Platform may display or rank services based on relevance, proximity, popularity, pricing, or user preferences. Such listings may also be influenced by promotional arrangements or marketing partnerships. MyFellowPet does not guarantee equal visibility to all Service Providers and does not engage in discriminatory filtering unless required for legal compliance or safety reasons.</p>
            <p>2.11. MyFellowPet shall not be responsible for any delays, cancellations, or unsatisfactory experiences resulting from third-party actions or unforeseen circumstances. However, Users are encouraged to report such issues promptly for appropriate investigation and resolution as per the Platform’s policies.</p>
            <p>2.12. The Company may introduce additional features, verification processes, or eligibility requirements for Users or Service Providers at its discretion. MyFellowPet also reserves the right to restrict access to specific services, categories, or regions as necessary for operational, regulatory, or safety reasons.</p>
        </div>
        
        

        <h2>3. NATURE OF SERVICES</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>3.1. MyFellowPet is a digital platform—comprising a mobile application and a website—designed to connect pet parents (“Users”) with independent pet service providers (“Service Providers”) offering a variety of pet-related services. The Platform enables Users to discover, compare, and book nearby services based on location, preference, and availability.</p>
            <p>3.2. Our services are designed to simplify the process of finding trusted and verified Service Providers by aggregating listings and making them accessible in one convenient place. Users can browse available services, evaluate their options, communicate with Service Providers through the in-app chat feature, and complete bookings directly through the Platform.</p>
            <p>3.3. The Platform serves solely as a <strong>facilitator</strong> that enables interactions and transactions between Users and independent Service Providers. It provides tools and features such as service listings, search filters, user ratings or reviews (where applicable), and booking and payment mechanisms. MyFellowPet does not itself offer or perform any pet care or related services.</p>
            <p>3.4. MyFellowPet’s objective is to provide a reliable, centralized, and user-friendly experience for discovering and accessing pet services. All bookings and payments are processed digitally through the Platform, and payments are securely managed through an integrated third-party payment gateway.</p>
            <p>3.5. Final booking confirmation occurs automatically once the User completes the booking process and payment on the Platform. Service fulfillment thereafter is the responsibility of the respective Service Provider. MyFellowPet’s role is limited to facilitating the transaction, processing payments, and ensuring that both parties can communicate and coordinate effectively through the Platform’s tools.</p>

            <h3>6.3. Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>Payments for bookings are processed exclusively through <strong>third-party payment gateways</strong> integrated into the Platform. The accepted payment methods (including credit/debit cards, UPI, or wallets) will be displayed during checkout. All transactions are processed in Indian Rupees (INR), unless otherwise specified.</p>
            <h3>6.4. Authorization and Responsibility</h3>
            <p>By providing Your payment information (“Payment Details”), You represent and warrant that:</p>

            <p>If, upon arrival or service initiation, the Service Provider finds that the pet’s details (including species, breed, size, behavior, health condition, or any disclosed information) <strong>materially differ</strong> from the details provided during booking, the Service Provider reserves the right to <strong>refuse or cancel the service without any obligation for refund</strong>.
            Such rejections are permitted in order to maintain safety, service integrity, and fairness. Users are therefore required to provide accurate and complete pet details during booking. MyFellowPet shall not be held liable for any loss or inconvenience arising from such rejections.</p>

            <h3>6.8. Payment Settlement</h3>
            <p>MyFellowPet facilitates payments between Users and Service Providers through an authorized third-party gateway.

        <h2>7. CANCELLATIONS, REFUNDS, AND DISPUTES</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <h3>7.1. Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
            <p>All cancellations and refund requests are governed by MyFellowPet’s <strong>Cancellation and Refund Policy</strong>, which forms an integral part of these Terms, along with the <strong>individual refund and cancellation rules set by each Service Provider</strong>.
            Each Service Provider specifies their own refund conditions including timelines, deduction percentages, and eligibility (for example, cancellations made before 24 hours, 12 hours, or 4 hours of the booking start time). These terms are displayed to the User at the time of booking and are binding once the booking is confirmed.
            Refunds will be processed strictly in accordance with:</p>
            <ol class="sub-lettered-list">
                <li>the specific refund terms defined by the respective Service Provider, and</li>
                <li>the Company’s Cancellation and Refund Policy framework.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>No refund shall be issued for cancellations made after service commencement, or where a Service Provider refuses service due to incorrect, incomplete, or misleading pet details (including species, breed, temperament, or health conditions).
            Refund timelines may vary depending on the User’s payment method and the processing timelines of the third-party payment gateway or banking partners.</p>
            <h3>7.2. Disputes with Service Providers</h3>
            <p>Any dispute or complaint related to the performance, timing, quality, or outcome of a service shall be raised <strong>directly with the concerned Service Provider</strong> through the Platform’s chat or support feature.
            While MyFellowPet may, at its discretion, assist by providing communication channels or limited mediation support, such facilitation does not imply that MyFellowPet assumes any responsibility for the Service Provider’s performance, commitments, or refund decisions.
            MyFellowPet is a neutral facilitator and not a party to the service contract between Users and Service Providers.</p>
            <h3>7.3. Resolution and Remedies</h3>
            <p>In case of a dispute regarding cancellation, refund amount, or service non-performance, the final refund or compensation amount (if any) shall be determined based on:</p>
            <ol class="sub-lettered-list">
                <li>the applicable Service Provider refund policy,</li>
                <li>the MyFellowPet Cancellation and Refund Policy, and</li>
                <li>any relevant evidence or communication submitted by both parties.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>MyFellowPet’s decision, made in good faith and in accordance with the above, shall be final and binding to the extent permitted by law.</p>
            <h3>7.4. Reporting and Support</h3>
