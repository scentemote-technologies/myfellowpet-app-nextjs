        <h1>Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>This Cancellation and Refund Policy (“Policy”) governs the terms and conditions under which users (“Pet Parents”) may cancel bookings and request refunds via MyFellowPet (the “Platform”), which operates as an intermediary connecting pet owners with independent pet service providers (“Service Providers”).</p>
        
        <p>By using the Platform and confirming a booking, users agree to be bound by this Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Cancellations by Pet Parents for “Overnight”</h2>
        
        <p>A confirmed overnight booking may be cancelled by the user at any time. Each day within the booking period is treated as an individual unit, and users may cancel any of the upcoming unused days, even after the service has commenced.</p>
        
        <div class="note-box">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> “Scheduled opening time” refers to the official opening time of the boarding center on the specific day for which the service is being cancelled.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Refunds:</h3>
        <p>Refunds, if any, for cancelled days are handled directly by the <strong>Service Provider</strong> based on their individual refund policy. The Platform displays the refund information provided by the Service Provider at the time of booking. Users are encouraged to review the refund details before cancelling.</p>

        <h2>2. Cancellations by Service Provider for “Overnight”</h2>
        <p>If a confirmed overnight booking is cancelled by the Service Provider, the user will be eligible for a full refund for the affected day(s).</p>
        
        <div class="important-note">
            <h3>Important:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All refunds are handled directly by the <strong>Service Provider</strong>. The Platform does not process or guarantee payments.</li>
                <li>As an aggregator, we will support you by helping communicate with the Service Provider and facilitating your refund.</li>
                <li>In cases where the Service Provider cannot accommodate your pet, we will assist in finding an alternative boarding center so you’re not left stranded.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Booking Modifications</h2>
        <p>Once a booking is confirmed, the service dates and duration are final. <strong>Modifications to the booking, including changes to the booking dates, are not permitted.</strong></p>
        <p>To change the scheduled service period, the user must cancel the existing booking and make a new booking.</p>

        <h2>4. Refund Processing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All refunds, if applicable, are handled directly by the <strong>Service Provider</strong>. The Platform does not process or guarantee any refund.</li>
            <li>The Platform may assist users in communicating with the Service Provider regarding refund status.</li>
            <li>Refund timelines, amounts, and any deductions are determined solely by the <strong>Service Provider</strong>.</li>
            <li>The Platform is not responsible for delays or non-payment by the Service Provider, banks, payment gateways, or other financial service providers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Force Majeure and Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
        <p>In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as natural disasters or other force majeure events, any refund or exception is determined solely by the <strong>Service Provider</strong>. The Platform may assist users in communicating with the Service Provider regarding such situations but does not guarantee any refund or exception.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Acceptance of Policy</h2>
        <p>By proceeding with a booking on the Platform, users acknowledge and agree that refunds and cancellations are managed directly by the <strong>Service Provider</strong>. The Platform only facilitates access to the Service Provider’s policy and communication. It is the user’s responsibility to read, understand, and comply with the Service Provider’s refund and cancellation terms before confirming any booking.</p>
