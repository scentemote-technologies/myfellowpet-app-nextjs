        <p>At MyFellowPet, We are committed to protecting Your privacy and the confidentiality of the information You share with Us. We deeply value the trust You place in Us and adhere to industry-standard security practices to protect Your personal data and ensure secure transactions through the Platform.</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Notice explains how MyFellowPet collects, uses, stores, discloses, and safeguards Your personal information when You access or interact with the Platform.

        <p>This Privacy Notice sets out the manner in which Your information is collected, received, stored, analyzed, processed, monitored, used, disclosed, reviewed, encrypted, transferred, or otherwise handled by Us through the Platform. It applies exclusively to information collected by MyFellowPet in connection with Your use of the Platform. It does not apply to any data You may share directly with third parties, or to information collected by third-party websites, applications, or services that may be linked to, or accessible through, the Platform.

        <h2>Permissions We Use and Why</h2>

        <p>MyFellowPet requests only the permissions necessary to deliver essential features of the app. We do not use any permission in the background or without your explicit action. Below is a clear explanation of each permission and why it is required:</p>

        <h3>1. Location (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION & ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To help users discover the nearest available pet service providers based on their current location. This improves search accuracy and user convenience.</p>
        <p>We do not track continuous location or store exact movement data.</p>

        <h3>2. Camera (CAMERA)</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Required for upcoming features that allow users to take photos of their pets to upload as profile photos and for sharing images with boarding service providers.</p>
        <p>The camera is only activated when the user manually opens the camera inside the app.</p>

        <h3>3. Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO & MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS)</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Used to enable voice messages during the final step of the boarding booking process when chatting with the service provider. Audio is recorded only when the user taps and holds the microphone button—never in the background.</p>

        <h3>4. Storage / Media (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, READ_MEDIA_DOCUMENTS)</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To allow users to upload photos, videos, or documents from their device (e.g., pet images, pet vaccination certificates, or house photos for service providers).</p>
        <p>We cannot access any files unless the user manually selects them.</p>

        <h3>5. Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS)</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To send booking alerts, chat notifications, payment confirmations, and general updates related to your app activity. Users may disable notifications at any time.</p>

        <h3>6. Bluetooth (BLUETOOTH)</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reserved for optional future features involving Bluetooth-enabled pet accessories. It is not used unless the user manually connects a device.</p>

        <h3>7. Internet (INTERNET)</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Required for all core app functions such as booking, chatting, uploading files, and viewing service provider details.</p>



        <h2>1. Collection of Information</h2>
        
        <p>We collect various types of information from You when You access or use the Platform, register or create an Account, or interact with MyFellowPet in any manner. This Privacy Notice applies to the following categories of information collected by MyFellowPet:</p>

        <h3>a) Personal Information</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>When You voluntarily register or engage with MyFellowPet, You may provide information such as Your full name, phone number, email address, gender, date of birth, address (including postal code), pet details, profile photographs, business/professional credentials (if You are a service provider), and other personal identifiers. Depending on the services availed, we may also collect identification documents (e.g., Aadhaar, PAN, passport, voter ID, driver's license) and verification materials. Technical information such as Your IP address, device identifiers, browser type, device model, connection speed, operating system, and general usage patterns may also be collected.</p>
            <p>Providing such Personal Information is voluntary. However, some features or services on the Platform may be unavailable without it. We collect, use, store, and share this information strictly in accordance with applicable laws and this Privacy Notice. In certain cases, particularly during the booking process, some of this Personal Information, such as <strong>Your phone number and pet details</strong> may be shared with selected service providers by the Platform’s administrative team to facilitate communication and coordination of services. You will be informed of such sharing during the booking interaction.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>b) Sensitive Information</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>In compliance with applicable laws, we may collect the following types of Sensitive Personal Information, where required:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Account passwords or login credentials</li>
                <li>Financial details (bank account, UPI, card information)</li>
                <li>Health, medical, or behavioral records (e.g., pet health details or special care needs)</li>
                <li>Biometric identifiers (if any)</li>
                <li>Microchip or tracking data associated with pets</li>
                <li>Any other legally designated sensitive personal data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that any publicly available information or information disclosed under applicable laws will not be treated as Sensitive Personal Information.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>c) Transactional Information</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>When You book pet boarding services via the Platform, we collect details related to Your transaction and booking, including selected service provider, booking dates, pet information, preferences, special instructions (if any), booking history, and post-service feedback. MyFellowPet does not process or manage payments; all payments are made directly between You and the selected service provider.</p>
            <p>As part of the booking process, MyFellowPet’s administrators will actively coordinate communication between You and the selected service provider. With Your prior consent, this involves initiating a call or messaging exchange in which Your phone number and relevant pet information will be shared with the service provider. This step ensures both parties can discuss the booking, clarify expectations, and confirm details such as care requirements, availability, and service suitability before proceeding.</p>
            <p>Once the service provider approves the booking after this conversation, You will receive a booking confirmation through the Platform. You may then proceed to make payment directly to the service provider as per their preferred payment method.</p>
            <div class="important-note">
                While MyFellowPet facilitates communication and coordination between users and service providers, <strong>all financial transactions occur independently outside the Platform</strong>. We encourage You to exercise caution and review the payment terms and privacy policies of the respective service providers before making any payments. MyFellowPet is not responsible for any disputes, losses, or issues arising from direct payment transactions between users and service providers.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>d) Location-Based Information</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>When You use the Platform on a mobile phone, tablet, or other internet-connected device, we may collect technical and location-related data such as Your IP address, device type, operating system version, browser settings, time zone, and connection speed.</p>
            <p>If You grant location access through Your device settings, we may gather and use <strong>precise geolocation data</strong> (via GPS, Wi-Fi, or mobile networks) to enable core functionalities — like suggesting nearby pet boarding centers, tailoring content based on location, and enhancing search accuracy.</p>
            <p>You can manage or disable location permissions anytime within Your device settings. Please note that restricting access to location data may affect certain location-driven features and limit the full use of the Platform.</p>
            <p>We may also use IP-based location data for internal purposes such as troubleshooting, analytics, and system administration.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>e) Non-Personal and Technical Data</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>We may collect non-identifiable technical and usage data, such as:</p>

            <p>This Non-Personal Information is used for analytics, security, improving user experience, content relevance, and platform performance. You can manage cookie preferences through browser settings.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>f) User Content and Communications</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Any information You post or share on public forums, review sections, chat rooms, or through support interactions (email, chat, social media) may be collected and retained to improve services, respond to inquiries, and resolve disputes.</p>
            <p>We may also receive third-party communications (e.g., reports of abuse or feedback about Your service experience) and store that information as required to comply with legal or service obligations.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <h2>2. Usage of Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected from You for the following purposes:</p>

        <p>Please note that we do not share Your personal information with other users of the Platform without Your <strong>explicit consent</strong>.
